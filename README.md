# TASK-IT-TO-ME

Task-it-to-me is an amazing command line application designed to solve
all your tasking needs. There are projects and tasks. Tasks live inside
projects. Memorize the menus when you first see them and you will be
fine.

This app was made by Derek, genius in residence. It is made in node!

If you have any questions about how it is made, just read a computer
science book. It is all there.

## Setting up the app

`npm install`

## Running the app

`npm start`

## Tests

The app is really perfect as it is, and I am sure no modifications will
ever be necessary. But if you do need to change it, the tests can be run
via:

`npm test`
